# Contributors to binary_trees Project

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure used in computer science and mathematics. It is composed of nodes where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves.
